# django-socialnetworks

Initially this package was intended to provide "Log in with..." capabilities to Django projects, but slowly as it was included in some of my projects it has growth to be a simple but powerful API client for some of the services that actually supports OAuth.

This package is built on top of the [Python Requests library](http://docs.python-requests.org/) and heavyly based/inspired in [django-socialregistration app](https://github.com/flashingpumpkin/django-socialregistration) but with some improvements and needs required in my projects.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gGonz/django-socialnetworks.svg?branch=v0.5)](https://travis-ci.org/gGonz/django-socialnetworks)



## Installation

```bash
# Default installation
$ pip install django-socialnetworks

# Install security egg
$ pip install django-socialnetworks[security]
```

## Usage

1. Add ```socialnetworks``` and the service's apps that you require to your ```INSTALLED_APPS```.

	```python
	# my_project/settings.py
	
	INSTALLED_APPS = (
	    ...
	    ...
	    'socialnetworks',
	    'socialnetworks.facebook',
	    'socialnetworks.twitter'
	    ...
	    ...
	)
	```

2. Set the ```SOCIALNETWORKS_CONFIGURATION``` dictionary.

	```python
	# my_project/settings.py
	
	SOCIALNETWORKS_CONFIGURATION = {
	    'EMAIL_IS_USERNAME': False,
	    'FACEBOOK': {
	        'APP_ID': 'my-facebook-app-id',
	        'APP_SECRET': 'my-facebook-app-secret',
	        'SCOPE': ['first_name', 'last_name', 'username']
	    },
	    'TWITTER': {
	        'APP_ID': 'my-twitter-app-id',
	        'APP_SECRET': 'my-twitter-app-secret',
	        'SCOPE': ['name', 'screen_name']
	    },
	}
	```

3. Add the allowed for login app backends to your ```AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS```.

	```python
	# my_project/settings.py
	
	AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
	    ...
	    ...
	    'socialnetworks.facebook.backends.FacebookBackend',
	    'socialnetworks.twitter.backends.TwitterBackend',
	    ...
	    ...
	)
	```

4. Add ```socialnetworks``` to your project urls.

	```python
	# my_project/urls.py
	
	urlpatterns = patterns('',
	    ...
	    ...
	    url(r'^social/', include('socialnetworks.urls', namespace='socialnetwork')),
	    ...
	    ...
	)
	```

5. Show ```Log in with...``` button in your templates.

	```html
	...
	...
	{% load facebook %}
	...
	...
	{% facebook_login 'Button text' 'css_class' %}
	...
	...
	```

6. Request data from the service's API. Note that the clients **must be initialized** with the proper OAuth profile.

	```python
	from socialnetworks.facebook.clients import FacebookClient
	
	client = FacebookClient(user.facebookoauthprofile)
	data = client.get('me', params={'fields': 'first_name,last_name'})
	data['first_name']
	>>> 'John'
	```

## Available settings

Global:

+ `COOKIE_MAX_AGE`: The max age of the cookies if you are storing social account data in cookies. Defaults to 900.
+ `EMAIL_IS_USERNAME`: Tell whether the email is used as username in the site. Defaults to True.
+ `ACTIVATE_ALREADY_REGISTERED_USERS`: Tell wheter to activate already registed but inactive users whose match a profile retrieved from the service's API. This is useful if you implement registration by sending an activation link and allow social login/registration at the same time. Defaults to False.
+ `SETUP_TEMPLATE`: The name of the template used to render the setup view if needed.
+ `SETUP_FORM_CLASS`: The name of the form class to be used to complete the setup process if needed.

App specific:

+ `APP_ID`: The id of your app given by the service.
+ `APP_SECRET`: The secret key of your app given by the service.
+ `APP_ACCESS_TOKEN`: The access token of your app if required/given by the service (Facebook).
+ `SCOPE`: A list of strings representing the scope of the tokens to be generated, you must check the available scopesprovided by the service you are using and it may require your app to be configured to request these scopes. By default it tries to request the email in the way it is provided specifically by each service.
+ `SESSION_KEY`: The key to be used to store the relevant OAuth process data in the user's session. Defaults to 'dsn' + the representative letters of each service, ie, 'dsnfb', 'dsntw', etc.
+ `SESSION_FIELDS`: The retrieved fields from the service's API that will be stored in the user's session if you are using cookies to store social account data.
+ `SETUP_URL_NAME`: A custom url name for redirect the users to complete the account setup. This url name must be provided in the format 'namespace:url-name' since it will be resolved by using django.core.urlresolvers.reverse. This setting is useful if you want to complete the setup in an AJAX view. When the user is redirected to this url a 'dsnstp' cookie containing the user's data retrived from the service's API wit a max age of two minutes (120 seconds). Note that this cookie is a base64 encoded JSON dumped string.

Service specific:

+ PayPal:
    + `IS_LIVE`: Tell if your app is in live or sandbox mode to make the requests to the proper API endpoints.


# Preload social account data in your views

This is useful if you need to display data retrieved from the service's API in your views, for example if you want to display the username and profile picture of the current user in the service.

First you need to set the fields that will be retrieved from the service and stored in a cookie (cookies are used to avoid the data not to be updated if the user updates its profile in the service, cookies are by default set to live for 15 minutes before a new requests to the service's API is made).

```python
# my_project/settings.py

SOCIALNETWORKS_CONFIGURATION = {
    ...
    ...
    'FACEBOOK': {
        'APP_ID': 'my-facebook-app-id',
        'APP_SECRET': 'my-facebook-app-secret',
        'SCOPE': ['first_name', 'last_name', 'username'],
        'SESSION_FIELDS': ['username', 'picture.type(normal)']
    },
    ...
    ...
}
```

**Note that since these methods make requests to the service's APIs is highly probably that the applied views results in slower rendering or timeout errors.**

```python
# my_project/views.py

from socialnetworks.facebook.decorators import fetch_facebook_data
from socialnetworks.facebook.utils import read_facebook_data


class MyDecoratedView(TemplateView):
    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        context = super(MyDecoratedView, self).get_context_data(**kwargs)

        # Read the social data previously stored in a cookie and makes it
        # available in the view's context.
        context['facebook_data'] = read_facebook_data(self.request)

        return context

    # Prefetch the social data for the current authenticated user and store it
    # in a cookie.
    @method_decorator(fetch_facebook_data)
    def dispatch(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return super(MyDecoratedView, self).dispatch(request, *args, **kwargs)

```

Then render the retrieved data in the view's template.

```html
...
...
<span>{{ facebook_data.username }}</span>
<img src="{{ facebook_data.picture.data.url }}" />
...
...
```

## Making requests to the service's APIs

First you need to initialize a client, then call the proper ```get``` or ```post``` method for the action you want to make passing the resource and the parameters or the data tu retrive/put.

**Nothe that this is a work in progress, GET requests should work ok, but POST must have some caveats depending on the service.***

```python
from socialnetwork.facebook.clients import FacebookClient


client = Facebook.client(user.facebookoauthprofile)

# Retrieve data
data = client.get('me', params={'fields': 'first_name', 'last_name'})
print data
>>> {'first_name': 'John', 'last_name': 'Smith'}

# Post data
client.post('me', data={'first_name': 'Juan'})
data = client.get('me', params={'fields': 'first_name', 'last_name'})
print data
>>> {'first_name': 'Juan', 'last_name': 'Smith'}
```
